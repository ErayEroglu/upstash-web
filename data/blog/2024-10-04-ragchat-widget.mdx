Letâ€™s set up a chatbot on your site in 5 minutes.

## Project Setup

If you already have a project, you can skip this step.

We will use the Blog template from Vercel:
```bash
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog blog
cd blog
```

Let's update the Next.js version and start the development server:
```bash
pnpm update next@14.2.14
pnpm dev
```

You can now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the blog.

## Environment Setup

### OpenAI Setup

Got to [OpenAI Platform -> Dashboard -> API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create a new API key, copy it and save it somewhere safe.

### Upstash Vector Setup

Go to [Upstash Console - Vector](https://console.upstash.com/vector) and create a new Index:

![Create an Upstash Vector Index](/blog/ragchat-widget/create-index.png)

Scroll down to **Connect** section, and select **.env**. Copy the content and save it somewhere safe.

![Vector Index Environment Variables](/blog/ragchat-widget/vector-env.png)

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables with the values you copied:

```bash
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL=<YOUR_URL>
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Chatbot Setup

Install the `@upstash/ragchat-widget` package:

```bash
pnpm add @upstash/ragchat-widget
```

Import the `ChatWidget` component in `app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
...
import { ChatWidget } from "@upstash/ragchat-widget";
...
```

Add the `ChatWidget` component to the layout:

```tsx
...
        <main className="flex-auto min-w-0 mt-6 flex flex-col px-2 md:px-0">
          <Navbar />
          <ChatWidget />
          {children}
          <Footer />
          <Analytics />
          <SpeedInsights />
        </main>
...
```

You can now see the chatbot widget on your site.

## Provide Context to the Chatbot

<Note type="tip">
  Is your data in another format? `@upstash/rag-chat` provides [native content processors](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/sdks/rag-chat/gettingstarted#managing-your-knowledge-base) and [Unstructured integration](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/sdks/rag-chat/integrations/unstructured) to embed PDFs, CSVs, Web Pages, and more.
</Note>

Now we will provide the blog posts as context to the chatbot.

First we install the `@upstash/rag-chat` package to use its native content processors:

```bash
pnpm add @upstash/rag-chat
```

Then we create a route handler to add the blog posts as context in `app/api/add-context/route.ts`:

```ts
import { RAGChat, openai } from "@upstash/rag-chat";
import fs from 'fs'

const ragChat = new RAGChat({
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini")
});

export async function GET(request: Request) {
    const files = fs.readdirSync(process.cwd() + "/app/blog/posts");
    for (const file of files) {
        await ragChat.context.add({
            type: "text-file",
            fileSource: process.cwd() + "/app/blog/posts/" + file,
          });
    }
    return new Response("Context added");
}
```

Finally, we visit the `http://localhost:3000/api/add-context` to add the blog posts as context. You should see the message "Context added".

Try asking questions related to the blog posts in the chatbot:
- What are the advantages of using Vim?
- Spaces or tabs, which one should I use?
- Tell me the importance of static typing.

## Deploy

You can deploy your site to Vercel with the following command:

```bash
vercel
```
