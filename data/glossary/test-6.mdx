A cache is a component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or the duplicate of data stored elsewhere. If requested data is contained in the cache (cache hit), this request can be served by simply reading the cache, which is comparatively faster. Otherwise (cache miss), the data has to be recomputed or fetched from its original storage location, which is comparatively slower. Hence, the greater the number of requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the overall system performance becomes.

Caches are used in a variety of systems, including CPU caches, web caches, and distributed caches. They are used to speed up data access and reduce the load on underlying storage systems.

## Cache Hit
- A cache hit occurs when the requested data is found in the cache.
- Cache hits are faster than cache misses because the data is already stored in the cache and can be accessed quickly.
